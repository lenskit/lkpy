2025 Releases
=============

The 2025 release series is **currently in development**.  No specific release
date is set yet.

2025 will bring breaking changes to several LensKit APIs to improve ergonomics,
correctness-by-default, and flexibility.  It also adopts SPEC0_, a standard for
supported versions of scientific Python libraries, and changes the LensKit
version number scheme to “:ref:`SemCalver`”.

2025.1 (in progress)
--------------------

The first 2025 release is currently in-progress.

This document presents the highlights for this release. The full changelog for this release is available in the `Git history <https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy/compare/0.14.4...main>`_
and `issue/PR milestone <https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy/milestone/14>`_.

Significant Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2025.1 brings substantial changes to LensKit.

*   :class:`~lenskit.data.Dataset`.  LensKit now provides an abstraction for
    training data instead of working with Pandas data frames directly, that
    allows components to reduce code duplication and recomputation, access data
    in multiple formats (Pandas, NumPy, and PyTorch), and provided standardized
    structures like mappings of user or item IDs to array indices.  This also
    supersedes the old bespoke dataset loading support, with functions like
    :func:`~lenskit.data.load_movielens` to load standard datasets.

*   New classes like :class:`~lenskit.data.ItemList` for routing item data
    instead of using Pandas data frames and series.  This makes component return
    types more self-documenting (rather than requiring developers to remember
    what is on the index, what the column names are, etc.), and facilitates more
    efficient data transfer between components that do not use Pandas (e.g. data
    passed between components using PyTorch can leave the data in tensors
    without round-tripping through Pandas and NumPy, and keep this transparent
    to client code).

*   Data splitting for offline evaluation has been moved into
    :mod:`lenskit.splitting`, updated to work with data sets and item lists
    instead of raw data frames, and splitting functions have been renamed (e.g.
    ``rows`` to ``records``) and had parameters updated for clarity and
    consistency.

*   Where Pandas data frames are still used, the standard user and item columns
    have been renamed to ``user_id`` and ``item_id`` respectively, with
    ``user_num`` and ``item_num`` for 0-based user and item numbers.  This is to
    remove ambiguity about how users and items are being referenced.

*   **PyTorch**. LensKit now uses PyTorch to implement most of its algorithms,
    instead of Numba-accelerated NumPy code.  Algorithms using PyTorch are:

    * :py:class:`~lenskit.algorithms.knn.ItemItem`
    * :py:class:`~lenskit.algorithms.als.ImplicitMF`
    * :py:class:`~lenskit.algorithms.als.BiasedMF`

*   Many LensKit components (batch running, model training, etc.) now report progress with
    :py:mod:`progress_api`, and can be connected to TQDM or Enlighten.

*   Algorithms refactored to more consistent package locations, without the
    ``algorithms`` subpackage.

*   LensKit no longer has top-level exports (and is now in fact a namespace
    package).  Classes and functions must be imported from appropriate
    subpackages.

*   The ``Popular`` recommender has been removed in favor of :class:`~lenskit.algorithms.basic.PopScore`.

New Features (incremental)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added RBP top-N metric (:pr:`334`).
* Added command-line tool to fetch datasets (:pr:`347`).

Evaluation Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The DCG metric has been removed, as it is basically never used and was not
  useful as a part of the NDCG implementation.

Model Behavior Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most models will exhibit some changes, hopefully mostly in performance, due to
moving to PyTorch.  There are some deliberate behavior changes in this new version,
however, documented here.

* ALS models only use Cholesky decomposition (previously selected with the
  erroneously-named ``method="lu"`` option); conjugate gradient and coordinate
  descent are no longer available.  Cholesky decomposition is faster on PyTorch
  than it was with Numba, and is easier to maintain.
* The default minimum similarity for :class:`~lenskit.algorithms.knn.UserUser`
  is now :math:`10^{-6}`.
* k-NN algorithms no longer support negative similarities; ``min_sim`` is clamped
  to be at least the smallest normal in 32-bit floating point (:math:`1.75 \times 10^{-38}`).
* The :mod:`implicit` bridge algorithms no longer look at rating values when they are present.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed bug in NDCG list truncation (:issue:`309`, :pr:`312`).
* :py:func:`lenskit.util.clone` now properly clones tuples (:pr:`358`).
* Corrected documentation errors for :py:func:`~lenskit.metrics.topn.recall` and :py:func:`~lenskit.metrics.topn.hit` (:pr:`369` by :user:`lukas-wegmeth`).

Dependencies and Maintenance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Bumped minimum supported dependencies as per SPEC0_ (Python 3.10, NumPy 1.23, Pandas 1.5, SciPy 1.9).
* Added support for Pandas 2 (:pr:`364`) and Python 3.12.
* Improved Apple testing to include vanilla Python and Apple Silicon (:pr:`366`).
* Updated build environment, dependency setup, taskrunning, and CI to more consistent and maintainable.
* Removed legacy random code in favor of :py:mod:`seedbank` (:pr:`351`).
* Code is now auto-formatted with Ruff.
