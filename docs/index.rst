LensKit
=======

LensKit is a set of Python tools for experimenting with and studying recommender
systems.  It provides support for training, running, and evaluating recommender
algorithms in a flexible fashion suitable for research and education.

LensKit for Python (also known as LKPY) is the successor to the Java-based
LensKit toolkit and a part of the LensKit project.
