    Call a metric, instantiating it if necessary.  This intended to be a quick
    convenience when you just need to call a metric with its default settings
    and don't want to mess around with object/class distinctions.  You usually
    don't actually want to use it.

    Supports both the base :class:`Metric` protocol and the extensions in
    :class:`PredictMetric`.

    Args:
        metric:
            The metric to call.  Note that the type of ``Callable`` is slightly
            too loose, it actually needs to be a class that subclasses
            :class:`Metric`.
        outs:
            The output to measure.
        test:
            The test data to measure.
