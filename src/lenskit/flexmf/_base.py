    The regularization method to use.

    With the default L2 regularization, training will use sparse gradients and
    the :class:`torch.optim.SparseAdam` optimizer.

    ``None``
        Use no regularization.

    ``"L2"``
        Use L2 regularization on the parameters used in each training batch.
        The strength is applied to the _mean_ norms in a batch, so that the
        regularization term scale is not dependent on the batch size.

    ``"AdamW"``
        Use :class:`torch.optim.AdamW` with the specified regularization
        strength.  This configuration does *not* use sparse gradients and may
        train more slowly.

    .. note::
        Regularization values do not necessarily have the same range or meaning
        for the different regularization methods.
